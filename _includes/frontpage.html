          <b class="slogan">Formerly...</b>
          <br>I graduated from the University of Calgary with a Master's degree of Electrical and Software Engineering in May 2023, meanwhile I took an Internship at <a href="https://altaml.com">AltaML</a> to practice my skills in an industrial level as a Machine Learning Developer and I was able to show my skilss in many aspects. Befor that, I was a full-time AI Specialist at <a href="http://fanap.ir">Fanap Co.</a>, where I worked on the prediction of resources on a cloud platform.

            Throughout my Bachelor study I did not have enough time to explore all sides of data, even though I did gain a lot of experience working in Cognitive Computing Lab (CCL) on a Robot Hand Sensing project to track a magnet inside an amputet hands muscles.
            This Tracking was done with the help of Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs) and I was able to publish my very first paper on it. my main contributions during my bachelors project are:
            <li>ObjectLocalizationinHandinordertoControla Robot Hand Using RNN.</li>
            <li>Noisecancellationinmagnetic-basedlocalizationusingcomplex-valued neural networks.</li>
            <li>Robustmagnet-basedlocalizationsystemtosensordis-placementusingthe Genetic Algorithm (GA).</li>

            During my Master's, I achieved a lot in the field of computer visions with my role as a Research Assistance. I was able to work on various types of images including and not limited to, IR, RBG, UAV and etc. My main contributions could be pointed out as follows:
            <li>Object detection with the help of Multitask Learning (MTL) to improve the Mask R-CNNs ability to detect small objects with higher precision. </li>
            <li>This method was applied on backbone of the object detection methods to enrich their output feature maps</li>
            <li>The Object detection methods used for this improvement on UAV data were YOLO, Mask R-CNN, and DETR.</li>
